CLAUD LOVAT FRASER</a></h4>

<div class = "verse ital">
<p>That when I die this word may stand for me&mdash;</p>
<p>He had a heart to praise, an eye to see,</p>
<p class = "in2">And beauty was his king.</p>
</div>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Dead</span> at the age of thirty-one after
a sudden operation, Claud Lovat Fraser was as surely a victim of the war
as though he had fallen in action. He was full of vigour for his work,
but shell-shock had left him with a heart that could not stand a strain
of this kind, and all his own fine courage could not help the surgeons
in a losing fight. We are not sorry for him&mdash;we learn that, not to
be sorry for the dead. But for ourselves? This terror is always so
fresh, so unexampled. I&nbsp;had telephoned to him to ask whether he
would help me in a certain theatrical enterprise. I&nbsp;was told by his
servant that he was ill, but one hears these things so often that one
gave but little thought to it beyond sending a telegram asking for news;
and now this. Personal griefs are of no public interest, but here is as
sad a public loss as has befallen us, if the world can measure truly, in
our generation.</p>

<p>But it is not, I think, of our loss that we should speak now. These
desolations, strangely, have a way of bringing their own fortitude.
A&nbsp;few hours after hearing, without any warning, of Lovat Fraser’s
death, I&nbsp;was walking among the English landscape that he loved so
well, and I felt there how poor and inadequate a thing death really was,
how little to be feared. This apparent intention to destroy a life and
genius so young, so admirable, and so rich in promise, seemed, for all
the hurt, in some way wholly to have failed. We all knew that, given
health, the next ten years would show a splendid volume of work from the
new power and understanding to which he had been coming in these later
days. But just as it seems to me not the occasion to lament our own
loss, so does it seem idle to speculate with regret upon what art may
have lost by this sudden
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<!-- png 010 -->
stroke. It is, rather, well to be glad that so few years have borne so
abundantly. Not only is the work that Lovat Fraser has left full in
volume, it is decisive in character beyond all likelihood in one of his
years. Greatly as he would have added to our delight, and wider as his
influence would have grown, nothing he might have done could have added
to our knowledge of the kind of distinction that was his and that will
always mark his fame.</p>

<p>The man himself had a charm of unusual definition. One might go to
his studio at five o’clock and find him lumbering with his great frame
among a chaos of the rare and curious books that he loved, stacked
pell-mell on to the shelves, littered on tables and the floor, his
clothes and face and fingers streaked with paint. And then an hour or
two later he would come dressed ready for the theatre, an immaculate
beau of the ’fifties, his top coat with waist and skirts, his opera hat
made to special order by a Bond Street expert on an 1850 last. And then,
before setting off, he would talk of some fellow-artist who was a little
down and out, and wonder whether some of his drawings might not be
bought at a few guineas apiece. Then to book, as it were, such an order
gave salt to his evening, and if the evening meant contact with some of
his own exquisite work, a&nbsp;word of admiration was taken with that
wistful gratitude that it is now almost unbearable to remember.</p>

<p>The theatre is a complex, co-operative affair, and it is idle to
inquire who gives more than another to it. But on one side of its effort
nobody in these later years has fought for light and beauty more surely
and courageously than Claud Lovat Fraser. Like every fine artist, he was
sometimes a little puzzled, a&nbsp;little hurt, that the critics could
not see the clear motives inspiring his work. But the purpose never
faltered. <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i>, <i>If</i>,
the exquisite designs for Madame Karsavina’s later ballets&mdash;these
made it plain enough that a new genius of extraordinary power and
fertility was at work on the stage. With a knowledge of tradition that
combined the widest learning with profound intuition, Lovat Fraser in
his design touched the life of five
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<!-- png 011 -->
hundred years with the English spirit of our own time, with a certainty
that every one of his colleagues, I&nbsp;know, will be proud to allow
was beyond them all. The fertility of which I speak was perhaps his
peculiar distinction, and it had no touch of common facility. He could
not draw a line that was not hard with thought and rooted in imaginative
decision. But he could invent with immense rapidity. It was the old,
though rare, story. Alike in his theatre design and his tender
landscape, beauty of spirit flowed in everything he did into beauty of
execution. He was a man in whose presence everything mean or slipshod
withered.</p>

<p>But perhaps it is most fitting at this time that we should think of
our dead friend in yet another way. We are governed by two influences,
our own character, and example. For each man his own character is for
his meditation apart, but of example we may sometimes speak together in
the open with profit. Those of us who live always striving towards
creative effort believe passionately that the thing towards which we aim
makes for all that is most chivalrous and most intelligent in life, that
it is indeed the one true honesty in the world. And yet we know how
easily that effort is beset by fears and jealousies and failure in
generosity, how lightly we who should together give all our energy to
the service of our art, waste it in little concerns of spite and
self-interest. And it is in just such ways as this that great example
may serve us nobly, and there has surely never lived an artist in whom
such example more clearly shone. Art, which for him embraced and
crystallised all that was brave and adventurous and tender, was the
worship of Lovat Fraser’s life, a&nbsp;worship which he kept with an
absolute loyalty.</p>

<p>It is my privilege to know most of the best artists, in all kinds, of
my age. One has this distinction, another that. But I think that he had
the loveliest of them all. I&nbsp;have known nobody who brought to his
art a devotion so pure and utterly removed from self-interest. If he
could serve the beauty that he loved, he was eager always to do so with
perfect indifference to his own reward. Nobody could be with him for ten
minutes without
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<!-- png 012 -->
feeling that art was a thing far greater than any artist. He had the
lovely, humorous humility that is the one sure sign of greatness. One
felt always that if he should think that another might do given work
better than&nbsp;he, there could be for him nothing but distress if the
best was not done, even though it meant the loss of personal
opportunity. But it is one of the happy things of genius that this
exquisite humility can only live with great creative gifts, so that
Lovat Fraser knew from day to day the supreme joy of mastery. The
humility, however, is our example, and the thought that seems most
worthy to-day is that he stands at this moment, for all he was younger
than most of us, as a challenging leader to us all. It will,
I&nbsp;think, always be impossible to remember him without feeling that
anything mean or grudging in the spirit in which we do our work is a
betrayal and an intolerable thing. With all his gaiety, his fun, his
simplicities, and his powers, he showed us not only what a fine artist
can do but what a fine artist can be. And under his leadership at this
moment may we not go back to our work in the world with renewed courage
and faith,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.”</p>
</div>

<p>For his fame none of us have any fear. There is in his public
achievement and his portfolios a solid body of work that more and more
must establish itself. However futile prophecy in these things must be,
one is confident that a hundred years hence his name will be highly
honoured among the little band who helped to bring back some life and
truth to the English theatre of this age. He would wish for nothing
better than that. And idle though it is to ask what his death, at little
more than youth, may mean in the way of loss to the art that he lived
for, his friends know that as dear a life as any of our time has gone
suddenly, inexplicably, taking with it the tenderest love of every one
who knew him. And he leaves with us an example without any stain.</p>

THE BEGGAR’S OPERA</a></h4>

<h6>NOTE ON THE SCENE AND COSTUMES AT THE LYRIC THEATRE,
HAMMERSMITH</h6>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Superficially</span> the task of staging
<i>The Beggar’s Opera</i> was one of supreme ease. Indeed, so easy was
it that it became a matter of some embarrassment to prune and select the
required amount of data. Here was Hogarth and his actual scene of
Newgate with Macheath in chains; here was Laroon’s <i>Cries of
London</i> falling, in its edition of 1733, pat into the period; here
was the National Portrait Gallery and, added to these, here was the
benefit of all Mr. Charles&nbsp;E. Pearce’s research.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> After a month or two of
work in designing, the ease became so marked and apparent that it
engendered in me the beginnings of mistrust. Still, I&nbsp;persevered in
scene and costume with historically accurate reproduction and, until
three weeks before the actual work was due to be carried out at the
costumier’s and in the painting shops, I&nbsp;felt comparatively
cheerful. Then I reviewed my forces&mdash;the little scale models of the
scenes, the characters in painted cardboard&mdash;all exact and
accurate. Something was wrong and the result was, I&nbsp;confess,
appalling.
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<!-- png 014 -->
I&nbsp;had not made allowances either for my theatre or for my audience.
I&nbsp;had forgotten that it required a spacious Georgian theatre, the
intimacy of the side-boxes, the great personages sitting on the stage.
The Duke of Bolton, Major Pauncefoot and Sir Robert Fagg were not in
their places as in Hogarth’s painting; the pit would not be filled with
tye-wigs and hoops and there would be a sharper line of division between
the actors and the spectators than ever existed in 1728. Something else
had to be done. As reproduction was a failure one would try to give an
impression of the same thing. Impressionism proved even worse than
accuracy. It was neither one thing nor the other. It merged into “making
a picture of it”&mdash;a crime that is without parallel in the staging
of a play. To make a pretty picture at the expense of drama is merely to
pander to the voracity of the costumier and scene-painter.</p>

<p>What was then to be done? Added to all these objections was the
important fact that I had designed scenes that would have seriously
hampered the resources at Hammersmith. The theatre would have required
more space for storage than could possibly have been given and, in
addition, an army of stage hands would be wanted for whom there was not
in this little theatre the accommodation.</p>

<p>The solution was, of course, to forget one’s past work, to scrap the
models, and to start feverishly afresh. The only method left untried was
the symbolic. That is to say, to hint at the eighteenth century and to
suggest that through the doors on the stage existed the London of 1728.
The scene demanded to be simple and one which, with slight modifications
in doors and windows, remained before the audience for the whole action
of the play. It was, therefore, to be a scene of which people did not
easily tire and that remained interesting, unobtrusive
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<!-- png 015 -->
and formally neat. To find such a scene it is necessary to refer back to
days when the Comic and the Tragic scenes were architectural and
permanent. This I did and, taking Palladio’s magnificent scene at
Vicenza, by a shameless process of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, evolved
the scene that is now in use at Hammersmith. Palladio and Gay have much
to forgive.</p>

<p>So far the scene, but it called for a corresponding treatment in the
dresses. In <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i> no one is in the height of
fashion. Macheath and certain Ladies of the Town alone “keep Company
with Lords and Gentlemen,” and even then there must have been apparent a
distinction. Macheath is unaltered. Here it was essential to keep to
tradition. Macheath in a blue coat is unthinkable. The rest of the
characters are frankly in the neighbourhood of Newgate. The clothes of
Peachum and Lockit would be as equally unfashionable and just as
possible thirty years before as thirty years after 1728, whilst the
footpads are clad in whatever Georgian rags that happened to come their
way. With the women I have taken greater licence. I&nbsp;have kept
faithfully to the outlines of the age, the close-fitting bodice, the
flat hoops, the square-toed shoes, but I have taken considerable
liberties in the manner in which I have shorn them of ribbons and laces
and&mdash;for the sake of dramatic simplicity, be it
remembered&mdash;I&nbsp;have eliminated yards of trimming.</p>

<p>Just so much explanation is, I consider, due to the public, but
whether I have been justified by results or whether, under the sacred
mask of Drama, I&nbsp;have erred unpardonably, are points which, so long
as this revival draws attention to a forgotten masterpiece, can be of no
very great importance.</p>

INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Beggar.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">If</span> Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I
am sure no-body can dispute mine. I&nbsp;own myself of the Company of
Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly Festivals at <i>St. Giles’s</i>.
I&nbsp;have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches, and am welcome to a
Dinner there whenever I please, which is more than most Poets can
say.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Player.</span> As we live by the Muses, it is
but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit wherever we
find&nbsp;it. The Muses, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no
Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake the Pertness of
Embroidery for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness. Be the Author
who he will, we push his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are
in Want) I&nbsp;wish you success heartily.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Beggar.</span> This piece I own was
originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of <i>James
Chaunter</i> and <i>Moll Lay</i>, two most excellent Ballad-Singers.
I&nbsp;have introduced the Similes that are in all your celebrated
<i>Operas</i>: The <i>Swallow</i>, the <i>Moth</i>, the <i>Bee</i>, the
<i>Ship</i>, the <i>Flower</i>, &amp;c.
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
Besides, I&nbsp;have a Prison-Scene, which the Ladies always reckon
charmingly pathetic. As to the Parts, I&nbsp;have observed such a nice
Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either of them
to take Offence. I&nbsp;hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made my
Opera throughout unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no
Recitative; excepting this, as I have consented to have neither Prologue
nor Epilogue, it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece
indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our
Great Room at <i>St. Giles’s</i>, so that I cannot too often acknowledge
your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Player.</span> But I see it is time for us to
withdraw; the Actors are preparing to begin. Play away the Overture.</p>

though he were to live these six Months, will never come to the Gallows
with any Credit. Slippery <i>Sam</i>; he goes off the next Sessions, for

Tailor, which he calls an honest Employment. <i>Mat of the Mint</i>;

diligent in his way; somewhat too bold and hasty, and may raise good
Contributions on the Public, if he does not cut himself short by Murder.

<p>But really, Husband, you should not be too hard-hearted, for you
never had a finer, braver set of Men than at present. We have not had a
Murder among them all, these seven Months. And truly, my Dear, that is a
great Blessing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> What a dickens is the Woman
always a whimpring about Murder for? No Gentleman is ever look’d upon

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Peachum.</span> If I am in the wrong, my

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> Murder is as fashionable a
Crime as a Man can be guilty of. How many fine Gentlemen have we in

wherewithal to persuade the Jury to bring it in Manslaughter, what are
they the worse for it? So, my Dear, have done upon this Subject. Was
Captain <i>Macheath</i> here this Morning, for the Bank-Notes he left
with you last Week?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Peachum.</span> Yes, my Dear; and though
the Bank hath stopt Payment, he was so chearful and so agreeable! Sure
there is not a finer Gentleman upon the Road than the Captain! if he
comes from <i>Bagshot</i> at any reasonable Hour, he hath promis’d to
make one this Evening with <i>Polly</i> and me, and <i>Bob Booty</i> at

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> The Captain keeps too good
Company ever to grow rich. <i>Marybone</i> and the Chocolate-houses are

Education of a fine Gentleman, and be train’d up to it from his
Youth.</p>

<p>You Baggage! you Hussy! you inconsiderate Jade! had you been hang’d,
it would not have vex’d me, for that might have been your Misfortune;
but to do such a mad thing by Choice; The Wench is married, Husband.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> Married! the Captain is a
bold Man, and will risk any thing for Money; to be sure he believes her
a Fortune. Do you think your Mother and I should have liv’d comfortably
so long together, if ever we had been married? Baggage!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Peachum.</span> I knew she was always a
proud Slut; and now the Wench hath play’d the Fool and Married, because
forsooth she would do like the Gentry. Can you support the Expence of a
Husband, Hussy, in Gaming, Drinking and Whoring? Have you Money enough
to carry on the daily Quarrels of Man and Wife about who shall squander
most? There are not many Husbands and Wives, who can bear the Charges of
plaguing one another in a handsom way. If you must be married, could you
introduce no body into our Family but a Highwayman? Why, thou foolish
Jade, thou wilt be as ill-us’d, and as much neglected, as if thou hadst
married a Lord!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> Let not your Anger, my Dear,
break through the Rules of Decency, for the Captain looks upon himself
in the Military Capacity, as a Gentleman by his Profession. Besides what
he hath already, I&nbsp;know he is in a fair way of getting, or of
dying; and both these ways, let me tell you, are most excellent Chances
for a Wife. Tell me, Hussy, are you ruin’d or&nbsp;no?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Peachum.</span> With <i>Polly’s</i>
Fortune, she might very well have gone off to a Person of Distinction.
Yes, that you might, you pouting Slut!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> What is the Wench dumb?
Speak, or I’ll make you plead by squeezing out an Answer from you.

Blacks of any kind, brought in of late; Mantoes&mdash;Velvet
Scarfs&mdash;Petticoats&mdash;Let it be what it will&mdash;I&nbsp;am
your Chap&mdash;for all my Ladies are very fond of Mourning.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> Why, look ye, Mrs.
<i>Dye</i>&mdash;you deal so hard with us, that we can afford to give
the Gentlemen, who venture their Lives for the Goods, little or
nothing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Trapes.</span> The hard Times oblige me
to go very near in my Dealing.&mdash;To be sure, of late Years I have
been a great Sufferer by the Parliament.&mdash;Three thousand Pounds
would hardly make me amends.&mdash;The Act for destroying the Mint, was
a severe Cut upon our Business&mdash;’Till then, if a Customer stept out
of the way&mdash;we knew where to have her&mdash;No doubt you know Mrs.
<i>Coaxer</i>&mdash;there’s a Wench now (’till to-day) with a good Suit
of Clothes of mine upon her Back, and I could never set Eyes upon her
for three Months together.&mdash;Since the Act too against Imprisonment
for small Sums, my Loss there too hath been very considerable, and it
must be so, when a Lady can borrow a handsom Petticoat, or a clean Gown,
and I not have the least Hank upon her! And,&nbsp;o’ my Conscience,
now-a-days most Ladies take a Delight in cheating, when they can do it
with Safety.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> Madam, you had a handsom Gold
Watch of us <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">’tother
</ins> Day for seven Guineas.&mdash;Considering we must have our
Profit.&mdash;To a Gentleman upon the Road, a&nbsp;Gold Watch will be
scarce worth the taking.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Trapes.</span> Consider, Mr.
<i>Peachum</i>, that Watch was remarkable, and not of very safe
Sale.&mdash;If you have any black Velvet Scarfs&mdash;they are a handsom
Winter-wear, and take with most Gentlemen who deal with my
Customers.&mdash;’Tis I that put the Ladies upon a good Foot. ’Tis not
Youth or Beauty that fixes their Price.
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<!-- png 103 -->
The Gentlemen always pay according to their Dress, from half a Crown to
two Guineas; and yet those Hussies make nothing of bilking of
me.&mdash;Then too, allowing for Accidents.&mdash;I&nbsp;have eleven
fine Customers now down under the Surgeon’s Hands&mdash;what with Fees
and other Expenses, there are great Goings-out, and no Comings in, and
not a Farthing to pay for at least a Month’s Clothing.&mdash;We run
great Risques&mdash;great Risques indeed.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> As I remember, you said
something just now of Mrs. <i>Coaxer</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Trapes.</span> Yes, Sir.&mdash;To be
sure I stript her of a Suit of my own Clothes about two Hours ago; and
have left her as she should be, in her Shift, with a Lover of hers at my
House. She call’d him up Stairs, as he was going to <i>Mary-bone</i> in
a Hackney Coach.&mdash;And I hope, for her own sake and mine, she will
persuade the Captain to redeem her, for the Captain is very generous to
the Ladies.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lockit.</span> What Captain?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Trapes.</span> He thought I did not know
him&mdash;An intimate Acquaintance of yours, Mr.
<i>Peachum</i>&mdash;Only Captain <i>Macheath</i>&mdash;as fine as a
Lord.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Peachum.</span> To-morrow, dear Mrs.
<i>Dye</i>, you shall set your own Price upon any of the Goods you
like&mdash;We have at least half a Dozen Velvet Scarfs, and all at your
Service. Will you give me leave to make you a Present of this Suit of
Night-clothes for your own wearing?&mdash;But are you sure it is Captain
<i>Macheath</i><ins class = "correction" title = "period in original">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Mrs. Trapes.</span> Though he thinks I have

About the Music</a></h4>

<p><i>The following information is also given in the text file
</i><tt>about_the_music</tt><i> in the “Music” directory.</i></p>

<p>The music in the printed book appears to be a hand-written copy of
the 1765 original, retaining or adding assorted minor errors. In
particular, the use of double bar lines or repeats seems to be almost
entirely arbitrary. In the PDF and MIDI files, obvious errors such as
missing dots after notes have been corrected, and a few ties have been
added. Repeats are used only when required by the lyrics as printed.</p>

<p>All music files, including the PDF images, are in the “Music”
directory. In addition to individual Airs, there are PDF files
containing the collected songs for each scene that has more than one
song. Air LXVIII (the final song) has been omitted because it takes up a
complete page by itself.</p>

<h5><b>Changing the Tempo</b></h5>

<p>If you want to change the tempo of a MIDI file, do this:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Install the lilypond program (free from lilypond.org)</p>

<p class = "inset">
Open the file you want to edit (named in the form <tt>air_N.ly</tt>
using the same Roman numerals as in the text) and scroll down to the
bottom. The <tt>make-moment</tt> line works just like a metronome
setting. Leave the second number alone&mdash;usually a 4 for
quarter-note&mdash;and make the first number larger or smaller.</p>

<p class = "inset">
Select “Run” or “Typeset File” from the Compile menu. This will create
three files in the same location as the original .ly file: an updated
MIDI, a new PDF, and a Postscript (<tt>.ps</tt>) file. You may keep the
Postscript file or delete it; they are automatically generated, but were
omitted from this Project Gutenberg text because they are very large and
are easy to make on your own computer.</p>
